# Ayo! I'm Lylythii.
- I like to work on ambitious projects, of all kinds.
- I make music in my spare time. You can find all that on my [Bandcamp](https://lylythii.bandcamp.com), [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/lylythii), [YouTube](https://youtube.com/channel/UCH6x-EVyOzVEfHPa_0Jy13A) & the-like.
- I like to break programs & things opens, use things to their fullest potentials. If it exists, I've probably tried to hack my way into it.

### Note
- Feel free to use these repositories as a reference. 
- Ensure you follow licencing correctly.
- Thank you.
